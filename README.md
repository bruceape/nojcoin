One nojcoin to rule them all.

## Todos
* Randomly deny steals.
* Provide an option to steal from yourself, but tweet something shaming.
* Provide different narratives that are randomly chosen for successful and failed steals.
* Provide dashboard for several stats.
	* Counter of number of steals (unique and total)
	* Counter for number of trades (unique and total)
	* Current value of nojcoin (based on last trade)
	* Counter on how many nojcoins are out there (only one)
* Mine action that just shows you animated gif of miner
* Trade action where you can provide a value for the coin.
* Rate limit stealing/trading, once a day per twitter handle.
* Need a favicon, avatar for twitter account, and maybe a coin image?

## Ideaspace
* Person holds coin for 24 hours
	* People are allowed to bid for it (bid stuff, but assign dollar value)
	* Highest bid (or chosen by owner) wins, coin trades hands
* Need a proper ledger for the nojcoin (centralized since there's only one)
	* Or maybe explain how this site functions as the ledger.
